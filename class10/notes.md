l4 mpi slides not in mid sem

- openMP intro (informal)
- in mpi, 1 process can't access data from another
- in openMP, we dont partition our ram -> first difference between mpi and openMP
- terminology change - 'threads' and not 'process'
- 'process' means its own resources
- 'threads' are light weight
- join & fork -> principle of openMP
- mpi - n process occupied during whole duration of program, whereas in openMP kill and create thread as needed
- distributed vs shared memory - MPI, openMP
- single/same OS required in openMP, can't use it for multiple desktops say
- if 1 process req is 1GB then 4GB req for 4 procs in MPI, this is a disadvantage
- wall time = computation + communication -> mpi; communication=0 in openMP
- openMP is a DIRECTIVE (wrt compiler terminologies)
- flag = "-fopenmp"
- all OMP directives begin with "!$omp" ("pragma" is C)
- clauses - options with directives
- 'master' & 'child' threads - terminology
- private data variables lost after parallel region
- rest syntax things in slide
- define a variable value only in one thread - use "omp master"
- unlike mpi, in openMP the do while is divided by openMP unlike we had to do in MPI
- "crtitcal" ensures "lock" so that multiple threads don't access same memory
