- cache incoherence - 2 threads see different values of same variable since synchronizatio has not been acheived yet
- cache levels - L1 (KBs), L2 (~1MBs), L3(~32MB)
- to show your work to community, you show STRONG SCALING visualisation
- here the problem size is fixed
- time vs n - slope=-1 (strong scaling)
- but it deviates from the straight line at some n,  this n is the optimised 

- Weak scaling
- T vs n -> straight line parallel to x-axis
- Fixing problem size per process
- same, deviating after some n
- how efficiently is able to manage the memory
- say HPC has 32 slots for ram with each having max 64gb capacity
- say we require 256GB RAM in our problem, then (a) 4*64GB vs (b) 32*16GB - b is better
- This is understood in weak scaling graph
- Strong scaling deviation reason - communication increase with n
- algo scalable, hardware - openMP vs MPI
- hybrid approach - memory problems
